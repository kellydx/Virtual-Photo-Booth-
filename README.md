# access-local-camera-with-HTML
Access the local camera from an HTML5 Web page, using the new navigator.getUserMedia(), 
and apply filters on image using CSS3 Filter Property

The Navigator.getUserMedia() method prompts the user for permission to use up to 
one video input device (such as a camera or shared screen)
and up to one audio input device (such as a microphone). 

(However, this feature will soon be removed from the Web standards. 
Though some browsers may still support it, it is in the process of being dropped.
I'll update this project with the new navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia soon)

The early stage of this project only work on accessing video devices
Working with audio features will be added later
